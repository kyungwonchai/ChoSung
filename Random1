column B10 with a new datetime value which is the average time difference between successive b columns, added to the datetime in B9. This should only happen when B9 is not null and B10 is null.

Here's how you can approach this in SQL:

Calculate the average time difference between each pair of b columns from B1 to B9.
Add this average time to B9 and update B10.
Here's a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

-- Calculate the average time differences and update B10
UPDATE TableA
SET B10 = DATEADD(SECOND, avgTimeInSeconds, B9)
FROM (
    SELECT 
        [Key], -- Assume there is a primary key or unique identifier for rows
        B9,
        (DATEDIFF(SECOND, B1, B2) +
         DATEDIFF(SECOND, B2, B3) +
         DATEDIFF(SECOND, B3, B4) +
         DATEDIFF(SECOND, B4, B5) +
         DATEDIFF(SECOND, B5, B6) +
         DATEDIFF(SECOND, B6, B7) +
         DATEDIFF(SECOND, B7, B8) +
         DATEDIFF(SECOND, B8, B9)) / 8.0 AS avgTimeInSeconds
    FROM TableA
    WHERE B9 IS NOT NULL AND B10 IS NULL
) AS SubQuery
WHERE TableA.[Key] = SubQuery.[Key] -- Linking subquery with main query
Explanation:
DATEDIFF: This function calculates the difference in seconds between two datetime columns.
AVG Calculation: We average the differences by summing them and then dividing by 8, since there are 8 intervals between B1 to B9.
DATEADD: This function adds the average time in seconds to B9 to get the new value for B10.
SubQuery: This is used to calculate the average time difference for rows where B10 is null and B9 is not null, ensuring that only valid rows are updated.
