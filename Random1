 the Ctrl key is pressed during a button click in a WPF application using C#, you can use the Keyboard.Modifiers property in the event handler. Here's an example code snippet in C#:

csharp
Copy code
private void YourButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (Keyboard.Modifiers == ModifierKeys.Control)
    {
        // Ctrl key is pressed
        MessageBox.Show("Ctrl key is pressed!");
    }
    else
    {
        // Ctrl key is not pressed
        MessageBox.Show("Ctrl key is not pressed.");
    }
}
In this example, when the button is clicked, the event handler YourButton_Click checks if the Ctrl key is pressed by examining Keyboard.Modifiers. If the Ctrl key is pressed, it will show a message box accordingly.
