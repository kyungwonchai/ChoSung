e error message "procname has incorrect type" typically indicates that the procname parameter you're passing to a function or method is not of the expected type. This can happen when, for example, you pass a string when a function expects a different type, such as a list, tuple, or integer. The specific resolution depends on where and how you're encountering this issue in your code.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the "incorrect type" error:

1. Check the expected type for procname:
The first step is to check what type the function or method is expecting for the procname argument. This is often documented in the function's documentation or in the method signature. For example, if you're passing procname to a SQL function or a database function, it could expect a string, or it might require a specific format (like a list of strings).

2. Ensure the correct type:
Once you know what type is expected, you can ensure that the procname is passed in the correct type. Here's how you might handle common scenarios.

Example 1: procname as a string
If the function expects procname to be a string (e.g., the name of a stored procedure or function), ensure you pass it as a string:

python
Copy code
procname = "my_stored_procedure"  # Correct type: string
Example 2: procname as a list or tuple
If the function expects procname to be a list or tuple of strings (e.g., a list of stored procedure names), you can convert it to the appropriate type:

python
Copy code
procname = ["proc1", "proc2"]  # Correct type: list of strings
Or, if it's a tuple:

python
Copy code
procname = ("proc1", "proc2")  # Correct type: tuple of strings
3. Debugging and Type Checking:
If you're unsure of the type being passed or why it's incorrect, use the type() function to check the type of procname before passing it:

python
Copy code
print(type(procname))  # Check the type of procname
This can help you identify whether it's a string, list, or some other type, and allow you to adjust it accordingly.

4. Example Context: SQL Procedure Call:
If you're calling a stored procedure in SQL using Python (e.g., with pyodbc or mymssql), the procname parameter should typically be a string representing the procedure name:

python
Copy code
import mymssql

# Assuming you're using mymssql or a similar package to call a stored procedure
connection = mymssql.connect('server', 'user', 'password', 'database')
cursor = connection.cursor()

procname = "my_stored_procedure"  # Ensure it's a string

# Call the procedure
cursor.callproc(procname, (param1, param2))  # Pass parameters if needed
5. Type Casting:
If the value for procname is dynamically generated or comes from user input, you may need to explicitly cast it to the correct type:

python
Copy code
procname = str(procname)  # Ensure procname is a string
