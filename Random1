ere is a VBA function that checks if a string includes "abcd" and returns "OK" or "NG" based on the condition:

VBA Code:
Open Excel.
Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
Click Insert > Module.
Paste the following code:
vba
코드 복사
Function CheckString(inputString As String) As String
    ' Check if the string contains "abcd"
    If InStr(1, inputString, "abcd", vbTextCompare) > 0 Then
        CheckString = "OK" ' Return "OK" if "abcd" is found
    Else
        CheckString = "NG" ' Return "NG" if "abcd" is not found
    End If
End Function
How to Use:
Go back to your Excel sheet.

Enter a string in cell A1 (e.g., "example abcd text").

In cell B1, type:

scss
코드 복사
=CheckString(A1)
Press Enter, and the result will be "OK" if "abcd" is in the string, otherwise "NG".

This function is case-insensitive and will work for any input string. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

In VBA for Excel 2016, you can use the Continue For statement indirectly to skip to the next iteration of a loop by using a combination of If...Then and GoTo statements.

Here's an example of how to skip to the next iteration in a For loop:

VBA Example:
vba
코드 복사
Sub SkipToNextExample()
    Dim i As Integer
    
    For i = 1 To 10
        ' Check a condition to skip to the next iteration
        If i = 5 Then GoTo NextIteration
        
        ' If the condition is not met, perform some action
        Debug.Print "Processing: " & i
        
NextIteration:
    Next i
End Sub
Explanation:
The loop runs from 1 to 10.
When i = 5, the program skips the current iteration by using GoTo NextIteration.
It jumps directly to the NextIteration: label, bypassing the processing step.
Best Practice:
Instead of GoTo, consider using structured If...Then statements:

vba
코드 복사
Sub SkipToNextBestPractice()
    Dim i As Integer
    
    For i = 1 To 10
        ' Skip to the next iteration if condition is met
        If i = 5 Then
            ' Use Exit For if you want to exit completely instead of skipping
            Debug.Print "Skipping: " & i
            GoTo Skip
        End If
        
        ' Perform some action if not skipping
        Debug.Print "Processing: " & i
        
Skip:
    Next i
