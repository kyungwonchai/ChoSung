ieve the functionality you described in a WinForms application using DevExpress 22.2, particularly with the GridControl, you'll want to dynamically filter data based on button clicks. Below are the steps and C# code snippets to help you set up this behavior:

Step 1: Setting Up the GridControl
First, ensure your GridControl is properly bound to a data source, and the column you're interested in (let's call it "ColumnA") is correctly configured.

Step 2: Initial Filter Setup
To filter the grid initially for values "DAS" in "ColumnA", you can set up the filter in the form's load event or right after initializing the grid.

csharp
Copy code
gridView1.ActiveFilterString = "[ColumnA] = 'DAS'";
Step 3: Button Click Events
You'll need to set up click events for each button (Button B and Button D in your case) to modify the grid's filter based on the user's action.

Button B - Filter for "DAS" or "PAOI"
csharp
Copy code
private void buttonB_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    gridView1.ActiveFilterString = "[ColumnA] = 'DAS' OR [ColumnA] = 'PAOI'";
}
Button D - Clear Filter
csharp
Copy code
private void buttonD_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    gridView1.ActiveFilter.Clear();
}
Considerations
Error Handling: Ensure that your application gracefully handles scenarios where "ColumnA" might not exist or the data source is empty.
User Feedback: Provide visual or textual feedback when filters are applied or cleared, enhancing user experience.
Testing: Test these functionalities under different scenarios to ensure they behave as expected across various data sets and states.
This setup should allow you to dynamically filter GridControl data in a WinForms application using DevExpress based on the specified conditions triggered by button clicks. If you have any specific requirements or encounter issues, feel free
