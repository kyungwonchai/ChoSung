e efficient data retrieval while minimizing network traffic, I'll provide a stored procedure that fetches every 16th row based on your sorting criteria (ipadd2, rowtime2 ASC). Then, I'll show you how to call this stored procedure using Python and pymssql.

Step 1: Create the Stored Procedure in MSSQL
Run the following SQL code in your MSSQL 2014 database:

sql
Copy code
USE your_database;
GO

-- Drop existing procedure if it exists
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.GetSampledData', 'P') IS NOT NULL
    DROP PROCEDURE dbo.GetSampledData;
GO

-- Create the stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.GetSampledData
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    WITH OrderedData AS (
        SELECT 
            modelname2 AS model, 
            jdbarcode2 AS barcode,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ipadd2, rowtime2 ASC) AS row_num
        FROM Table_jdbarcode
    )
    SELECT model, barcode 
    FROM OrderedData 
    WHERE (row_num % 16) = 1;
END;
GO
Step 2: Call the Stored Procedure from Python
Now, use the following Python code to call the stored procedure and load the sampled data into a Pandas DataFrame.

python
Copy code
import pymssql
import pandas as pd

# Database connection details
server = "your_server"
database = "your_database"
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

# Connect to the database
conn = pymssql.connect(server=server, user=username, password=password, database=database)
cursor = conn.cursor(as_dict=True)

# Execute stored procedure
cursor.callproc('dbo.GetSampledData')

# Fetch all results into a DataFrame
df_sampled = pd.DataFrame(cursor.fetchall())

# Close connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()

# Display DataFrame
import ace_tools as tools
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Sampled Data", dataframe=df_sampled)
Step 3: Explanation
Stored Procedure (dbo.GetSampledData)

Uses ROW_NUMBER() to order the data by ipadd2, rowtime2 ASC.
Selects only every 16th row to reduce unnecessary data transfer.
Uses SET NOCOUNT ON; to optimize execution.
Python Script

Connects to MSSQL using pymssql.
Calls the stored procedure using cursor.callproc('dbo.GetSampledData').
Fetches the sampled data and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame.
