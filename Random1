re's a conceptual approach to craft your query:

Use the CHARINDEX function to find the positions of the first two spaces (acting as delimiters) to locate the third string.
Use SUBSTRING to isolate the third string.
Use STUFF to replace the first character of the third string with 'Z'.
Reassemble the string for the final output.
However, SQL Server's string manipulation functions might not directly support complex operations in a single step, especially for varying string lengths and formats. The below example is a simplified approach focusing on a scenario where your strings are consistently formatted and the third string's first character can be identified reliably:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    STUFF(
        model1,
        CHARINDEX(' ', model1, CHARINDEX(' ', model1) + 1) + 1,
        1,
        'Z'
    ) AS ModifiedColumn
FROM 
    YourTableName
This query attempts to:

Find the first space using CHARINDEX(' ', model1).
Find the second space by starting the search after the first space CHARINDEX(' ', model1) + 1.
Use STUFF to replace the character immediately following the second space (which should be the first character of the third string) with 'Z'.
Keep in mind this solution makes several assumptions about the format of your data. Real-world scenarios might require more robust handling, especially if your strings can have variable formats or if there are different definitions of what constitutes a "string" in your data. For more complex manipulations, consider processing the data in your application code using C# or Python, where s
