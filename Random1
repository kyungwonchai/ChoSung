Here is a VBA function that checks if a string includes "abcd" and returns "OK" or "NG" based on the condition:

VBA Code:
Open Excel.
Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
Click Insert > Module.
Paste the following code:
vba
코드 복사
Function CheckString(inputString As String) As String
    ' Check if the string contains "abcd"
    If InStr(1, inputString, "abcd", vbTextCompare) > 0 Then
        CheckString = "OK" ' Return "OK" if "abcd" is found
    Else
        CheckString = "NG" ' Return "NG" if "abcd" is not found
    End If
End Function
How to Use:
Go back to your Excel sheet.

Enter a string in cell A1 (e.g., "example abcd text").

In cell B1, type:

scss
코드 복사
=CheckString(A1)
Press Enter, and the result will be "OK" if "abcd" is in the string, otherwise "NG".

This function is case-insensitive and will work for any input string. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
