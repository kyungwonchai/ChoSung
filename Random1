f you want to select rows where the first to third strings within a model1 column start with "BSM" and then modify or display them based on this condition, you can use a combination of SQL string functions like LEFT, SUBSTRING, and CHARINDEX to identify the strings and apply your conditions. Assuming that the strings are separated by spaces, here's how you could approach it:

Use CHARINDEX to find the positions of spaces that delimit your strings.
Use LEFT and SUBSTRING to extract the first, second, and third strings.
Use a CASE statement to check if these strings start with "BSM". If they do, you can then proceed to modify them as needed or simply select them.
Here's a sample SQL query illustrating this concept. This query doesn't modify the column but selects rows where the first to third strings start with "BSM". Modifying these strings would require additional logic based on what modification is needed:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    model1,
    CASE 
        WHEN LEFT(model1, 3) = 'BSM' AND 
             SUBSTRING(model1, CHARINDEX(' ', model1) + 1, 3) = 'BSM' AND 
             SUBSTRING(model1, CHARINDEX(' ', model1, CHARINDEX(' ', model1) + 1) + 1, 3) = 'BSM'
        THEN 'Your Modification Here' -- You can define how you want to modify the column here
        ELSE model1 -- Or decide what to do if the condition is not met
    END AS ModifiedColumn
FROM 
    YourTableName
This query:

Checks if the first three characters of model1 are "BSM".
Finds the first space and checks if the next three characters form "BSM".
Finds the second space and checks if the following three characters are "BSM".
Based on these conditions, it uses a CASE statement to determine what to show in the ModifiedColumn.
Please adjust "Your Modification Here" to match your specific requirements, whether it's selecting the original model1 value, modifying it, or displaying some other information. This query assumes that your data is consistently formatted and that there are always at least three strings separated by spaces in your model1 column. Adjustments might be needed for different data formats or requirement
