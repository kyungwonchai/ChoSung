nderstand you're looking to sort data within a DevExpress GridControl by multiple columns, specifically by Timestamp in descending order and another column in a specified order. Here's how you can achieve this in DevExpress 22.2:

1. Sorting by Multiple Columns in Code:

To sort the GridControl by multiple columns programmatically, you can use the SortInfo collection. This approach allows you to define the sorting order for each column explicitly. Here's an example:

csharp
코드 복사
using DevExpress.Data;
using DevExpress.XtraGrid.Columns;
using DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid;

// Assume 'gridView' is your GridView instance
gridView.BeginSort();
try
{
    gridView.ClearSorting();
    gridView.Columns["Timestamp"].SortOrder = ColumnSortOrder.Descending;
    gridView.Columns["AnotherColumn"].SortOrder = ColumnSortOrder.Ascending; // Change to Descending if needed
}
finally
{
    gridView.EndSort();
}
In this code:

BeginSort() and EndSort() methods are used to enclose the sorting operations, ensuring that the grid is updated only once after all sorting changes are applied, which improves performance.

ClearSorting() removes any existing sorting, allowing you to define new sorting criteria.

The SortOrder property of each column is set to specify the desired sorting direction.

2. Sorting by Multiple Columns at Design Time:

If you prefer to set up sorting at design time, you can use the SortOrder and SortIndex properties of the columns within the GridView. Here's how you can do it:

Set the SortOrder Property: This property determines the sorting direction (ascending or descending) for the column.

Set the SortIndex Property: This property specifies the order in which the columns are sorted. A lower SortIndex means higher priority in sorting.

For example, to sort by Timestamp in descending order and then by AnotherColumn in ascending order:

Set the SortOrder of the Timestamp column to Descending and its SortIndex to 0.

Set the SortOrder of the AnotherColumn to Ascending and its SortIndex to 1.
