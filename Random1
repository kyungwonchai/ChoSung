Here are the tasks for refactoring the code:

Refactor Button List Initialization:

The current code initializes the list of buttons (likely List<ButtonConfig>) and populates it with items directly at the point where the list field is declared.
Please change this structure:
First, only declare the list field (e.g., private List<ButtonConfig> buttonConfigs;).
Then, populate this list (i.e., assign new List<ButtonConfig> { ... } and add the new ButtonConfig { ... } items) inside the class constructor.
Implement Window Docking using DockManager:

You need to ensure that newly created windows/forms are docked using the DockManager. This DockManager should already be added or integrated into the project.
To dock the window, please use a function similar to tabbedview_add (this is likely a specific function in our project for adding a view to a tabbed interface and docking it; please verify the exact function name from the existing codebase).
Reference: For an example of how docking is implemented, you can refer to the "Cycle Time History" feature/button. When you click "Cycle Time History," it results in a docked view. Please use this as a guide.
The core requirement is to utilize the DockManager for this functionality. You have the flexibility to adapt the specific code pattern as you see fit.
Additional Note:

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions while implementing these changes, feel free to consult an AI assistant like GPT for guidance.
Key points in the translation to ensure clarity:

"cycle Time History클릭하시면 도킹이되는데 그 함수를 참조하셔셔 하시면되고" -> Incorporated as a reference point for the docking task.
"처음에 드렸던코드는 버튼의 리스트를 선언시 할당했지만 , 구조를 바꿔서 선언만 하고 할당은 생성자에서 하도록 변경해야합니다." -> Clearly translated into the two-step process for instruction 1.
"전에 드렸던 코드에도 있지만 DockManager를 추가한 상태에서 보내드린 코드에 tabbedview_add함수를 사용해서 생성한 창을 도킹하도록 하시면 됩니다." -> Translated to emphasize using DockManager and a function like tabbedview_add.
"코드 패턴은 편한대로 바꿔쓰시면 되고 핵심은 DockManager를 사용하면 된다는것입니다. (필요시 GPT문의)" -> Translated to allow flexibility and mention GPT.
