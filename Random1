nd in a WPF application with DevExpress GridControl, you can use event handlers and custom logic to modify the appearance of cells based on their values. This approach involves handling the CustomColumnDisplayText event for changing the display text and the CustomDrawCell event for changing cell background colors based on specific conditions.

Step 1: Define Event Handlers
First, you'll need to subscribe to the CustomColumnDisplayText event to handle the display text for your re5 column, and the CustomDrawCell event to change the background color of cells based on their values in the re5 and re7 columns.

Step 2: Implement the Logic
Here's how you can implement the logic:

csharp
Copy code
using DevExpress.Xpf.Grid;
// Assuming you have a GridControl named "grid"

// Subscribe to events (do this in your constructor or after initializing components)
grid.CustomColumnDisplayText += Grid_CustomColumnDisplayText;
grid.CustomDrawCell += Grid_CustomDrawCell;

private void Grid_CustomColumnDisplayText(object sender, CustomColumnDisplayTextEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Column.FieldName == "re5" && Convert.ToDouble(e.Value) == 99.73)
    {
        e.DisplayText = ""; // Set display text to empty for the value 99.73
    }
}

private void Grid_CustomDrawCell(object sender, RowCellCustomDrawEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Column.FieldName == "re5" && e.CellValue != null)
    {
        if (Convert.ToDouble(e.CellValue) == 99.73)
        {
            // Skip changing the background because you want to keep it transparent or default for 99.73
        }
        else
        {
            e.Appearance.Background = System.Windows.Media.Brushes.LightYellow;
        }
    }
    else if (e.Column.FieldName == "re7" && e.CellValue != null)
    {
        if (Convert.ToDouble(e.CellValue) < 6)
        {
            e.Appearance.Background = System.Windows.Media.Brushes.LightPink;
        }
    }
}
Notes:
Ensure you have error handling for the conversions (e.g., using double.TryParse), especially if the cell values might not always be convertible to double.
Adjust the logic as necessary to fit your exact requirements and data types.
This example directly modifies the appearance of cells based on their values during the drawing phase, which is efficient and suitable for dynamic styling based on data.
If your re5 or re7 field values can be null, make sure to include null checks to avoid exceptions.
